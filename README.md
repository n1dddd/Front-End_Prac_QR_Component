## My-Process

Built with Vite, React and vanilla CSS.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
- [React](https://react.dev)
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This simple front-end QR card reinforced flex-box basics,
element styling in a React front-end, keeping a responsive-
mobile foward front-end, and reusable CSS styling principles.

### Continued Development

I want to leap into CSS grid, and build a responsive navbar.Possibly utilizing materialUI in conjunction. I want to continue focusing on responsive-mobile forward development.
